# 911-calls
911 calls data analysis done by Dana Cassidy. I completed this jupyter notebook as a capstone project as part of my Data Science and Machine Learning Python Bootcamp. The questions were made by the instructor, Jose Portilla, but I fully completed the notebook on my own merit. I adjused some of the instructions to better fit my notebook layout. I also submitted this notebook on Kaggle.
